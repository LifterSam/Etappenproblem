This is my personal solution to a Cipsoft Coding Interview Challenge May 2025.

It implements `binary search on answer` as the algorithm to find the minimal maximum of travelling
distances for set stages and set days. Input data is read via the `input.txt` file in the subdirectory
`input` after a given formatting from Cipsoft. If you want to change input data you can replace the file
`input.txt` or set other values in it. The order of the values is shown in the representing
`Testaufgabe-Programmierer.pdf`.

I made the function names and variable names very self explanatory to safe unneccessary commenting.
Also since the time was limited i made no header files with dedicated .cpp-files for the functions but 
this could be implemented fast by just taking out the functions. They should be modular the way i
implemented them.

Best Regards
Thomas
